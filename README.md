# About The Project
This project came as a kit from amazon. The project involved building a smart car from the ground-up utilizing a Raspberry Pi. After Building the smart car there is a tutorial that guides in the process for programming it, using python.

After programming the smart Car, it now can Track where its going, use obstacle avoidance and lastly turn into a light show with the built-in lights that the car comes with.

The Project was great for where I am at, at my skill level because the included tutorial helped with programming and understanding what certain functions do and expanded on my knowledge.
